      A <b>ski</b> is a narrow strip of semi-rigid material worn underfoot to
      glide over snow. <br />Substantially longer than wide and
      characteristically employed in pairs, skis are attached to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_boot">ski boots</a>
      with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_binding">ski bindings</a>
      , with either a free, lockable, or partially secured heel. <br />For
      climbing slopes, ski skins (originally made of seal fur, but now made of
      synthetic materials) can be attached at the base of the ski. Originally
      intended as an aid to travel over snow, they are now mainly used
      recreationally in the sport of skiing.

    <h2>Etymology and usage</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The word ski comes from the Old Norse word skíð which means "cleft wood",
      "stick of wood" or "ski". <br />In Old Norse common phrases describing
      skiing were fara á skíðum (to travel, move fast on skis), renna (to move
      swiftly) and skríða á skíðum (to stride on skis).<br />
      In modern Norwegian the word ski has largely retained the Old Norse
      meaning in words for split firewood, wood building materials (such as
      bargeboards) and roundpole fence.<br />In Norwegian this word is usually
      pronounced [ˈʂiː]. <br />In Swedish, another language evolved from Old
      Norse, the word is skidor (plural, pronounced [ˈɧîːdʊr]; singular: skida).

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The oldest wooden skis found were in Russia (c. 6300–5000 BCE), Sweden (c.
      5200 BCE) and Norway (c. 3200 BCE) respectively.[13] Nordic ski technology
      was adapted during the early 20th century to enable skiers to turn at
      higher speeds. New ski and ski binding designs, coupled with the
      introduction of ski lifts to carry skiers up slopes, enabled the
      development of alpine skis. <br />Meanwhile, advances in technology in the
      Nordic camp allowed for the development of special skis for skating and
      ski jumping.

    <h3>Asymmetrical skis</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This type of ski was used at least in northern Finland and Sweden until
      the 1930s.[11] On one leg, the skier wore a long straight non-arching ski
      for sliding, and on the other a shorter ski for kicking. The bottom of the
      short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use,
      while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with
      animal fat in similar manner to modern ski waxing. Early record of this
      type of skis survives in works of Olaus Magnus.[15] He associates them to
      Sami people and gives Sami names of savek and golos for the plain and
      skinned short ski.

    <h3>Single long ski</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The seal hunters at the Gulf of Bothnia had developed a special long ski
      to sneak into shooting distance to the seals' breathing holes, though the
      ski was useful in moving in the packed ice in general and was made
      specially long, 3/4 meters, to protect against cracks in the ice. This is
      called skredstång in Swedish.
